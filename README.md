# Gofetch
An extremely simple and fast system info fetching program written in golang

## Installation
```
$ go install github.com/Try3D/gofetch@master
$ gofetch
```

## Development
I have used multiple different go packages to provide the system information. External Go packages being just git repos and the program being written modular means that anyone would be able to add their own sources easily.

This project is tested only on Linux. Usage in any other OS may or may not work optimally.
